## Notes

- If you are having trouble retrieving character data, use **"Reset and Stop"** in the plugin screen. This will change the character password and token information again. In this case, **you don't need** to match your character again.
- If your character **does not send data to the server for 5 minutes**; There will be "No connection" information in the mobile application. In this case, you may not see the character information in the mobile application.
- Each character can be matched with only one mobile app account.
- Create an issue for the problems and issues you are experiencing. You can also create an issue for the new features you want.
- Always download the latest version of the plugin from Github (https://github.com/ilkerccom/sromc-plugin). Also get the mobile apps from the store. We never share ".apk" style app installer files.
